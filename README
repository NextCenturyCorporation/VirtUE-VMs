1. A wrapper for GCC to disable PIE if compilation fails (see next steps)

Copy cc_nopie to /usr/bin

2. Get rumprun source code

git clone https://github.com/rumpkernel/rumprun

git submodule update --init

(This fetches additional source code from external repos)

3. Apply all necessary patches from rumprun-nfsd

4. Compile rumprun (for Xen)

CC=cc ./build-rr.sh xen

If it fails, use the wrapper script (see above). Before that make sure
to clean up obj-amd64-xen and rumprun/rumprun-x86_64
(if they were already created by the previous step)

The same procedure through the wrapper script:
CC=cc_nopie ./build-rr.sh xen

5. You need to set up network bridging in Xen. By default,
the NFS unikernel (currently) assumes IP address: 10.0.0.2 and
netmask: 255.255.255.0.

An example script for that is 'bridge.sh' which would normally
be executed after Dom0 boot-up. Make sure to change the
physical interface in the last line: --out-interface wlp3s0
(e.g., specify your actual NIC interface such as eth0, wlp3s0, etc)
